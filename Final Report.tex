	%Abstract

	\section{Abstract}
		The project 'Universal Interpreter' was built as an application to help the differently-abled people, i.e. deaf, dumb, blind or combination of any, by using Image Recognition and AI/ML. \newline
		
		The present world we live in, a world dominated by visual and audio peripherals, can prove to be a tough place to live in for differently abled people. Hence, this project was inspired by the need to use the very same dominating technologies to help the differently abled overcome their challenges. \newline 

		With Universal Interpreter, we make use of Morse Codes and the American Sign Language - two of the standardised forms of communication all over the world - to ensure that any differently-abled person can use the application for its intended purposes.\newline
